[00:07.71] I'll be home for Christmas
[00:15.72] You can count on me
[00:23.67] Please have snow and mistletoe
[00:31.10] And presents on the tree
[00:39.63] Christmas Eve will find me
[00:47.85] Where the love light gleams
[00:55.69] I'll be home for Christmas
[01:03.00] If only in my dreams
[01:48.20] Christmas Eve will find me
[01:56.30] Where the love light gleams
[02:04.30] I'll be home for Christmas
[02:11.50] If only in my dreams
