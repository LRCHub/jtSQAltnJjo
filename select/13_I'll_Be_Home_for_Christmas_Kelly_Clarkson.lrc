[00:15.82] I'll be home for Christmas
[00:26.53] You can count on me
[00:36.24] Please have snow and mistletoe
[00:43.03] And presents under the tree
[00:56.53] 
[00:53.09] Christmas eve with fondue
[01:01.99] With a love like this
[01:10.80] I'll be home for Christmas
[01:18.06] If only in my dreams
[01:28.06] 
[02:00.56] Christmas eve will find me
[02:10.23] With a love like this
[02:20.04] Well I'll be home for Christmas
[02:28.15] If only in my dreams
