[00:24.43] I'll be home for Christmas
[00:32.00] You can count on me
[00:39.63] Please have snow and mistletoe
[00:47.82] And presents on the tree
[00:59.82] 
[00:58.13] Christmas Eve will find me
[01:06.07] Where the love light gleams
[01:13.31] I'll be home for Christmas
[01:21.42] If only in my dreams
[01:31.42] 
[02:09.43] Christmas Eve will find me
[02:17.50] Where the love light gleams
[02:24.97] I'll be home for Christmas
[02:33.09] If only in my dreams
